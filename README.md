# Getting started with bootloader on mbed OS

This example shows how to create a bootloader.

To read more about the bootloader, please visit [bootloader tutorial](https://docs.mbed.com/docs/mbed-os-handbook/en/latest/advanced/bootloader/).

## Required hardware
* A supported board - [u-blox EVK-ODIN-W2](https://developer.mbed.org/platforms/ublox-EVK-ODIN-W2/), [Nucleo F429ZI](https://developer.mbed.org/platforms/ST-Nucleo-F429ZI/) or [K64F](https://developer.mbed.org/platforms/FRDM-K64F/).
* CI test shield.
* SD card.

## Import the example application

From the command-line, import the example:

```
mbed import mbed-os-example-bootloader
cd mbed-os-example-bootloader
```

## Preparing the bootloader

All supported boards mentioned above are set up to build as a bootloader image. To add support for a new board, you must specify the size of the bootloader.

To do this, set the target (replace `<TARGET_NAME>` with your target name) value `restrict_size` to the maximum bootloader size in mbed_app.json:

```
    "target_overrides": {
        ...
        "<TARGET_NAME>": {
            "target.restrict_size": "0x20000"
        },
        ...
```

Note - `restrict_size` pads the build image to the requested size.

## Now compile

Invoke `mbed compile`, and specify the name of your platform and your favorite toolchain (`GCC_ARM`, `ARM`, `IAR`). For example, for the ARM Compiler 5:

```
mbed compile -m <TARGET_NAME> -t ARM
```

Your PC may take a few minutes to compile your code. At the end, you see the following result:

```

Image: .\BUILD\<TARGET_NAME>\ARM\mbed-os-example-bootloader.bin
```

It creates two binary files. The original uncombined image is in the output directory, <project-name>_application.bin, and the bootloader image is <project-name>.bin.

When the build succeeds, you have created a bootloader for your target. This example defines the application file to be located at `/sd/mbed-os-example-blinky_application.bin` in the bootloader's ``main.cpp``. This is the application binary that bootloader flashes and then jumps to. If you are using a different application, ensure that ``main.cpp`` is pointing to the correct path for the application.

## Set up application to use bootloader

### Program bootloader and application

The next step is to build an application you can combine with your bootloader to create a loadable image. 

1. Update your board to use the newly created bootloader image. To do this, you will need to modify the application's ``mbed_app.json`` file (if your application does not have a ``mbed_app.json`` file already, you will have to create one). Set the target (replace `<TARGET_NAME>` with your target name) value `bootloader_img` to the file path of the bootloader image.

```
    "target_overrides": {
        ...
        "<TARGET_NAME>": {
            "target.bootloader_img": "bootloader/<TARGET_NAME>.bin"
        },
        ...
```

2. Invoke `mbed compile`, and specify the name of your platform and the toolchain you are using (`GCC_ARM`, `ARM`, `IAR`). For example, for the ARM Compiler 5:

    ```
    mbed compile -m <TARGET_NAME> -t ARM
    ```


1. Connect your mbed device to the computer over USB.
1. Copy the binary file (``<program name.bin>``) to the mbed device.
1. Press the reset button to start the program.

### Program application using SD card

1. Connect the SD card to your computer.
1. Copy the application binary (``<program name>_application.bin``, we defined it earlier as ``mbed-os-example-blinky_application.bin``) to the root of the SD card.
1. Remove the SD card from your PC. Ensure the CI test shield is attached to your device, and then plug the SD card into the CI test shield.
1. Press the reset button to start the firmware update.

If a terminal is open, the following should print out on baud rate of 115200:

```
Firmware update found
Starting application
```

## Troubleshooting

1. Make sure `mbed-cli` is working correctly and its version is `>1.0.0`.

    ```
    mbed --version
    ```

 If not, you can update it:

    ```
    pip install mbed-cli --upgrade
    ```

2. If using Keil MDK, make sure you have a license installed. [MDK-Lite](http://www.keil.com/arm/mdk.asp) has a 32 KB restriction on code size.
